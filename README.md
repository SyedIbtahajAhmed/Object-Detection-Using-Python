# Object-Detection-Using-Python
Object Detection using python and computer vision library.
It will work on less frames per second based on the processor of the computer.
Can be made better by using a graphics module or processor

This repository contains files
1. Coconames:which contains the names of the object that can be detected using yolo detection algorithm.
2. main.py:which contains the code of the real-time object detection code using the yolo algorithm.
3. yolo_object_detection.py:which contains the yolo algorithm.
4. yolov3.cgf:which contains the configuration of the yolo algorithm.
5. yolov3_weights file should be downlaoded separately.
6. A folder Named # Detected Cars should be created in the main folder to save the images of the detected cars.
